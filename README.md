# Based
Based is a decentralized social media platform created specifically for Base builders—developers, designers, creators, and innovators who work on the Base network. Our goal is to help builders connect, collaborate, and share their work while maintaining control over their data. Based also aims to bring more people onchain by helping newbies get involved in Web3 through a supportive community.

## Why Based?
The Base ecosystem is rapidly growing, with a diverse range of projects and ideas. However, it can be difficult to find the right people to collaborate with and learn about what the community is up to. Based solves this by bringing all Base builders together in one place, making it easier to find collaborators, stay updated on new projects, and engage with the community. Whether you’re a senior developer or a newcomer to Base, Based offers the perfect environment to grow and thrive within the network.

At Based, we aim to empower Base builders to connect and collaborate, helping onboard more people on the blockchain and driving growth within the Base ecosystem.
